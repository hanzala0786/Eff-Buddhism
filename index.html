                <h2 class="description">Effective Buddhism</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Thesis:</h3>
            <p>Buddhism is an amazing philosophy full of wisdom with great truths, however I believe Buddhists have
                lost the way of the Buddha and lack a real basis of impact. Effective Buddhism is a solution to those who
                seek to follow the Buddhist Path as Buddha Wanted. If Buddha was alive today, imagine the amount of change and impact he would be having.
            </p>
            <h3>Evidence:</h3>
            <p>In current Buddhist society, the top Buddhist role models have iron wills, but lack real ACTION or PURPOSE behind
                this because of a misinterpretation of Dharma. Buddha’s four main vows tell a different story of how the Buddha should act.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bodhisattva Vows exist in many different forms; they are chanted as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Creations are numberless, I vow to free them.</li>
                <li>Delusions are inexhaustible, I vow to transform them.</li>
                <li>Reality is boundless, I vow to perceive it.</li>
                <li>The awakened way is unsurpassable, I vow to embody it.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="bg bg2">
                <!-- <h2 class="description">Effective Buddhism</h2> -->

            </div>    
            <p>
                It’s also said in this way.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Living beings are limitless, I vow to liberate them all.</li>
                <li> Blind passions are limitless, I vow to sever them all.</li>
                <li> Dharma gates are inexhaustible, I vow to know them all.</li>
                <li> Unsurpassed is awakening, I vow to realize it.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Or, in the most laymen terms:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> To save all people</li>
                <li> To renounce all worldly desires</li>
                <li> To learn all teachings</li>
                <li> To attain perfect enlightenment</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you go searching, there are many other ways these four vows are written, but they are all telling the same thing, in this order.</p>
            <p>As anyone may observe from the outside, the most influential people in the world today are not Buddhists. On top of that anyone from a Non-Buddhist city, will tell you that they have not heard from a Buddhist about why that path is best. </p>

            <div class="bg bg1">
                <!-- <h2 class="description">Effective Buddhism</h2> -->

            </div>
            <p>
                It is a sickness is the Buddha communities today to ignore the first vow, and try to move on to 2,3, and 4. By the very means of the vows, step 2 cannot be done without first completing step 1. Step 1 is in fact, an earthly desire. The Four Main Vows are a harmonious right of passage that must be balanced in action towards their completion.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the way of the Buddha should be to renounce all worldly desires IN ORDER TO save all people, and to learn all teachings IN ORDER TO save all people, and that once these steps are completed perfect enlightenment will be attained. This means that these tasks are in harmony. As one renounces more wordy desires to spend more time saving people, one learns teachings to improve how they go about saving others, and rides the collective path towards enlightenment.</p>
            <p>However, instead of following this path and order, Buddhists today are known as people continually meditating. Struggling to awaken and renounce all worldly desires, and instead all acting to each other like they are farther along the path. I believe Buddhism has become a sick game of ineffective spiritual ego stroking.</p>
            <p>I am not saying that the Men and Women who have become great at meditating for hours and wholly living a minimalist life have not gone further down their path of enlightenment, instead that it is very sad that so much potential is moving towards the wrong place for the world to awaken and be saved. It is a fact these people who realize their potential to follow the first vow will be some of the strongest Buddhas there are. </p>
            <p>The funny thing about tech entrepreneurs who are rapidly changing the future, and Buddhism is that these tech entrepreneurs are slowly learning the way of the Buddha in order to optimize themselves. They are reaching new paths of enlightenment. Instead of referring to their actions as the Buddha way, they are learning the teachings of Buddha in order to be more effective.</p>
            <p>A few examples of parallel movements to the 10 precepts are:
                <br/><br>
                Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely.
                <br><br>
                Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
                <br><br>
                Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so.
                <br><br>
                Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry.</p>
            
            
            <div class="bg bg2">
                <h2 class="description">Reiterating The Message</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment rather than practicing the way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide, preaching and changing and influencing the world and his actions live on to this day. 
                <br><br>
                Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply meditate. The idea is to relinquish attachment to earthly desires in order to DO MORE. Not to meditate all day to do nothing. In an effort of learning all teachings, we will re-evaluate the core values, and give a new perspective based on the teachings. The core re-evaluation leads us to the idea that Nirvana is something to achieve in this realm. And that leaving this realm is a negative desire in it of itself.
                <br><br>
                Let’s break them down. <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is failed to be recognized by modern Buddhist society. Outreach is a non-factor. So many people who need this valuable information are left in the dark, with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual progress using technology (tools to increase impact) are completely disregarded.</li>
                    <li>Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to renounce. But here’s what the true text says “Desires for tangible things (such as wealth, property, or other material goods) or for pleasures of the body (such as sexual activity, gluttony, or other hedonistic pursuits). Buddhism teaches us to try to let go of our worldly desires, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of enlightenment.”As it says, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of enlightenment.</li>
                    <li>Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not even know how consciousness works yet. To learn all teachings, we need to learn by the act of doing. There is no better thing to learn at this time, than how to spread change like Buddha did.</li>
                    <li>
                        4. “In **Buddhism**, **enlightenment** (called bodhi in Indian **Buddhism**, or satori in Zen **Buddhism**)
                        is when a **Buddhist** finds the truth about life and stops being reborn because they have reached Nirvana.”
                        In order to stop the cycle of rebirth, we must stop the death to life cycle. With infinite time our particles
                        are always brought back to a conscious form. Until we find a conscious form to reach Nirvana in, we will repeat
                        the cycle. “**Rebirth** in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" target="_blank">Buddhism</a> refers to its teaching
                        that the actions of a person lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra" target="_blank">samsara</a> .
                        [1][2] This cycle is considered to be <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha" target="_blank">dukkha</a>, unsatisfactory and painful.
                        The cycle stops only if <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha" target="_blank"></a> is achieved by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism" target="_blank">insight</a>
                         and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana" target="_blank">extinguishing of craving.</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>
